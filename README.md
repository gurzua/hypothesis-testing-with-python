# 🧪 Hypothesis Testing with Python

This repository is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks focused on **statistical hypothesis testing**, covering frequentist approache.  
The goal is to provide clear, practical, and reproducible examples that help understand how to perform hypothesis tests, interpret results, and apply them to real-world data.

Each notebook includes explanations, formulas, implementations in Python, visualizations, and interpretations of results.
